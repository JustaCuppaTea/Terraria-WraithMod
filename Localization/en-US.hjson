# All localization happens in hjson files. These files contains the display names of content and other text values that will differ between languages.
# .hjson files contain translations for the language specified in the filename. (Make sure this file is UTF-8 encoded only.)
# The possible languages are: English ("en-US"), German ("de-DE"), Italian ("it-IT"), French ("fr-FR"), Spanish ("es-ES"), Russian ("ru-RU"), Chinese ("zh-Hans"), Portuguese ("pt-BR"), and Polish ("pl-PL")
# Localization files will be automatically updated with new content. After building and reloading the mod, new entries will appear in hjson files and can then be filled in.
# Here in ExampleMod we have organized these files in a folder called Localization. A single file per language makes it extremely easy to to integrate and maintain translations.
# Comments and non-autogenerated keys will be preserved and automatically mirrored to the non-English hjson files
# For more info on localization, see https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/wiki/Localization
